# Predicting-Criminals

In this project we will be **predicting whether a person will commit a crime or not** based on the dataset which contains several features on the personal and professional lives of several people which includes past criminal backgroung.

I have used Decision Tree algorithm to find whether the person will commit the crime or not and has got a accuracy score of **0.95328.**
